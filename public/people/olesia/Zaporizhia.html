      <p>The name Zaporozhia means "beyond the rapids".
        Before the Dniproges Dam was built, the rapids on the
        Dnipro river were a notorious impediment to navigation.</p>
      <p>Zaporizhia is a city on the Dnieper River in southeastern
        Ukraine. It's home to Khortytsia Island, a former Cossack
        stronghold with the Khortytsia National Reserve and the
        open-air Museum of Zaporizhian Cossacks.</p>
