      <p>Dnipro is an industrial centre of Ukraine that was a hub for the Soviet military industry.
        As such, no foreigners were allowed to visit without
        official permission until the 1990s.As an industrial centre still, it suffers from heavy
        pollution issues, but is generally well maintained and provides an interesting insight into real working life in Ukraine.</p>

      <p>While Dnipro is located in Ukraine, like many cities of Eastern Ukraine,
        it is very rare to hear people speaking the Ukrainian language.
        However this started to change following Russian military occupation of
        Crimea and Donbas regions of Ukraine.</p>
