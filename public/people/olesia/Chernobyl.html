      <p>On April 26, 1986, a sudden surge of power during a reactor systems test destroyed Unit 4 of the nuclear power station at Chernobyl, Ukraine, in the former Soviet Union. The accident and the fire that followed released massive amounts of
        radioactive material into the environment.<br>
        <p>The Chernobyl accident in 1986 was the result of a flawed reactor design that was operated with inadequately trained personnel.</p>
        <p>The resulting steam explosion and fires released at least 5% of the radioactive reactor core into the atmosphere and downwind â€“ some 5200 PBq (I-131 eq).</p>
        <p>Two Chernobyl plant workers died on the night of the accident, and a further 28 people died within a few weeks as a result of acute radiation poisoning.</p>
        <p>UNSCEAR says that apart from increased thyroid cancers, "there is no evidence of a major public health impact attributable to radiation exposure 20 years after the accident."</p>
        <p>Resettlement of areas from which people were relocated is ongoing. In 2011 Chernobyl was officially declared a tourist attraction.</p>
