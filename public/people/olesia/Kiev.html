      <p>Ukrainians are very proud of their capital's role in establishing European civilization in Eastern Europe.</p>
      <p> Kyiv is one of the oldest cities in Eastern Europe, dating back to the 5th century,
        although settlements at this location existed much earlier. By the late 9th century,
        Kyiv had become the de facto capital of an emerging Eastern Slavic state. Between the 10th and
        early 13th centuries, the city reached its golden age as the capital of the first Ukrainian state
        known today as Kyivan Rus, (Rus-Ukraine). This state created the religious and cultural foundations
        for modern Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia.</p>
      <p>In the middle of the 13th century, Kyivan Rus was overrun by the Mongols.
        Later that century, Kyiv became part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In 1569 the
        city was absorbed into the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and in 1654 it was liberated
        from that Commonwealth by the Cossack, Bohdan Khmelnytskyi, who then promptly signed
        the city over to Russia. This action continues to be a sore point for Ukrainian nationalists.</p>
      <p> In 1775, Kyiv was annexed by the Russian Empire. The city remained under Russian rule,
        with brief but uncertain periods of independence between 1918 and 1920. Over these two centuries,
        Kyiv experienced growing Russification and Russian immigration. After the collapse of
        the Soviet Union in 1991, it became the capital of independent Ukraine and is now
        discovering its place as a large European capital.</p>
      <p> It is generally acknowledged that the population is over 3,000,000 (2006 estimates).
        About 85% claim Ukrainian ethnicity and about 12% Russian. However, the census numbers
        are believed to be unreliable so these percentages must be taken with a
        pinch of salt. There are many minorities in the city, including Armenians, Azeris, Belarussians,
        Jewish, Georgians, Polish, Romanians and Tatars. Since 2001, not only has the population of Kyiv increased,
        but also the percentage of people claiming Ukrainian ethnicity. This is probably a result of the strong nationalist
        movement centered in Kyiv during the Orange Revolution (October 2004 to January 2005).</p>
      <p>Officially, all signs are in Ukrainian only. Since 2011, signs with Latin transliteration have been installed
        in the city center. Although many people continue to speak Russian, even most of these are ethnically Ukrainian.
        Hearing Ukrainian on the streets is now increasingly common.
        Although many Russian language-learning programs offer trips to the city, the usefulness of
        these trips is decreasing as the Ukrainian language in now in resurgence and the main language of the city
        again, after having been rarely heard since the beginning of the 20th century when it was
        discouraged by occupying Russian authorities.</p>
