      <p>Lviv (also spelled L'viv, Lvov and Львів; Russian: Львов,
        Polish: Lwów, German: Lemberg) is one of the biggest cities of regional significance in Ukraine.
        It was a part of Poland until 1939 when it became part of Ukraine. It is currently the biggest city in the region and a major Ukrainian cultural center.
        The historic city center is on the UNESCO World Heritage List.</p>
      <p> In Lviv, people are very proud of their history as linguistically, culturally,
        and ethnically the most Ukrainian city with a population of over half a million from World War II onwards.
        It is true that before this the majority was Polish, and it had great significance in Polish history.
        Some Poles will make claims to Lwów and refer to it as a "Polish city" due to its history; however, Poles today constitute a mere 0.9% of the population.
        The city also had a significant Jewish population prior to WWII.</p>
      <p> Many people do speak fluent Russian and Polish, due to history and regional significance. However,
        Russian is declining in usage because many young people are unable to speak it fluently because of its lack of relevance in daily life in the present day.
        Russian is considered increasingly a foreign language just like Polish or English which just happens to be more well-known,
        and is taught in most schools as such.Walking down the street you will
        rarely if at all hear conversations in Russian, which is a sharp contrast to most other Ukrainian cities of the same size.
        Do not expect everyone to speak Russian, especially younger people. This is generally considered to be quite rude.
        Many people in the city who can speak Russian also speak English; and if conversing with such a person,
        English would be considered a better choice. If you plan on language-learning before traveling to Lviv,
        please try to learn Ukrainian first. Some people may respond in Ukrainian even if you speak to them in
        Russian and they understand what you are saying. This is a way of making a point and letting you know subtly that they
        find your use of Russian to be impolite. This is why it's important to learn Ukrainian and respect the sentiments of the
        local population.</p>
